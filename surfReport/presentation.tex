\section{Setup}

\begin{frame}{Model Setup}

Each DC has a cooling system. % (\cite{adam:cooling}). 
Modify Liu et al.'s (2011) %\cite{adam:GLB}% 
model to include cooling costs. Use convex optimization to solve model as in Liu et al. (2011b). %\cite{adam:GLBfull}.

	\begin{block}{Workload}

	Web of source requests assumed at geog. centers in 48 U.S. states. 

	$L_j(t)$, mean request arrival rate from source $j$ at interval $t$ from real-world traces.

	Workload base trend from trace at H-P Labs.

	Scale workload of each request source by state population. 

	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{Renewable energy output} 

            Use 10min interval real wind speed \& insolation traces from http://wind.nrel.gov/.  %\cite{renew1} \cite{renew2}. 
	%@@@@@@[Is this true? I thought the traces were (calculated) power output.] 

	\vspace{1mm}
           DC renewable energy generation rate per plant $\propto$   Weather data.

	Total renewable energy =  $c$ $\times$ Total energy demand to process all requests, 	$c$ varies in $[0.5, 4]$ with a step length of $0.5$.

	 Use a mix of 80\% of wind and 20\% following Liu et al. (2011). % \cite{adam:GLB}.
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The internet-scale system}

Set $\mathcal{N}$ of 10 DCs at Google DCs in 10 states. \vspace{1mm}  %California, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. 

\#servers $X_i$ at DC $i$ = 2 $\times$ peak load at $i$  \vspace{1mm} 

% ***** when all requests are routed to nearest DCs. ******

Optimization: Choose routing plan $\lambda_{ij}(t)$ and \# active servers $x_i(t)$  to minimize total cost (= delay cost + energy cost + switching cost).

\begin{block}{Delay cost}
= Propagation delay $d_{ij}$ from source $j$ to DC$_i$  + queuing delay at $i$.

$d_{ij}$ = travel time from $i$ to $j$ at transmission speed $200 \frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{ms}}$ + $5 \mathrm{ms}$. \vspace{1mm} 

Queuing delay calculated from the parallel M/G/1/Processor.  \vspace{1mm} 

Sharing queue model: Total load $\lambda_i(t)=\sum_j \lambda_{ij}(t)$ distributed evenly across $x_i(t)$ homogeneous servers of service rate \mbox{$\mu_i$ = $0.1 / \mathrm{ms}$}.

\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cooling-aware optimization}

	Minimize energy consumption to maintain DC at $T = 25^{\circ}\textrm{C}$. 

	\#active servers $x = x_a + x_c$  where a=air-cooled, c=water chilled. \vspace{1mm} 

	Find best division between $x_a$ and $x_c$.

	\begin{block}{Air-cooling energy consumption} \vspace{-3mm}
	\begin{equation}
           c_a(x) = k \cdot x^3, 0 \leq x \leq \bar{x}, k > 0
 	\end{equation}

 $k$ $\propto$ temperature gradient between the inside and outside air. 

$\bar{x}$ = maximum \#servers cooled by air cooling alone. 

$\bar{x}$ $\propto$ temperature gradient, maximum air flow rate. 

\vspace{2mm}

We set air flow rate to level that can air cool DC entirely at full workload when outside temperature is lower than   $T - 20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. 
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Chilled-water cooling}

Energy consumption roughly linear in IT demand empirically: 
\begin{equation}
c_c(x) = \gamma \cdot x
\end{equation}
%Here $\gamma = 0.17$, meaning that the chiller takes 0.17kW/h electricity to cool the heat caused by 1kw/h of IT demand.
%For notational convenience, define
\begin{equation}
	x^+ \eqdef \min(0, x)
\end{equation}
% to be $x$ clamped to be positive.

\begin{block}{Optimal cooling portfolio}
\begin{equation}
c(x) = \min_{x_c \in [0,x]} \gamma \cdot (x-x_c)^+ + kx_2^3
\end{equation}
which yields
$$
c(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
	k \cdot x^3 & \mbox{if $x \geq x_s$}\\
	k \cdot x_s^3 + \gamma \cdot (x-x_s) & \mbox{otherwise}\end{array} \right.
$$
where $x_s = \min \left(\sqrt{\gamma/3k}, \bar{x}\right)$ is the threshold for when chiller cooling is necessary.

\begin{frame}{Cost savings from Cooling-aware GLB}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=cost_diff.pdf, height=2.2in, width=3.2in}
\caption{The difference between optimal costs in summer/winter for both Cooling-aware and Cooling-oblivious GLB}
\end{figure}

The cooling-aware geographical load balancing model reduces firm's energy cost by routing the requests to locations where energy is cheap and cooling is easy. Such a savings outweighs the increase in delay cost. Hence our model is consistent profit maximization by a firm.

%In this experiment, the aggregate amount of renewable energy is set to be the total IT demand multiplied by a coefficient, where the coefficient series is the integer multiples of 0.5 within [0.5, 4]. We run the experiment under both summer and winter weather.

Our first experiment explores the cost efficiency of the this model. Figure 2 illustrates the extent of total cost savings of our model. We choose the total cost under Cooling-oblivious GLB and LOCAL as the benchmark. The Cooling-aware model gives lower cost than both benchmarks. This edge is rather clear under two situations. First, in summer when cooling is expensive, the Cooling-aware model significantly outperforms Cooling-oblivious model; by considering the energy cost of cooling, it makes routing decisions to use renewable energy optimally. Second, when the aggregate renewable energy available lies between once and twice the aggregate demand, and some but not all data center locations have a surplus in renewables, the Cooling-aware GLB exploits this surplus better than the benchmarks.

We are interested in how well the Cooling-aware GLB model works in different seasons and weather conditions. Figure 3 shows the difference between the optimized costs in summer and in winter using each model. The previous Cooling-oblivious model's performance varies significantly with seasonality; our Cooling-aware GLB model's performance is more robust. This finding suggests that our Cooling-aware model exploits the heterogeneity in weather to reduce the energy required for cooling.

\begin{frame}{Environmental impact - \carbondioxide{} savings}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=carbon_summer.pdf, height=2.2in, width=3.2in}
\caption{Comparison of carbon emission of Cooling-aware GLB, Cooling-oblivious GLB and LOCAL.}
\end{figure}


The geographical load balancing method model exploits variation in energy costs by routing requests to where energy cost is low. When the data centers have on-site renewable energy plants (as in our setting), renewable energy becomes cheap; the model allows optimal usage of these renewables and thus has the desirable side-effect of reducing carbon emissions.

We can estimate the \carbondioxide{} emissions by multiplying the grid energy usage of each data center location by the \carbondioxide{} emission per energy unit. Figure 4 shows the \carbondioxide{} emission comparison of each model in summer. By using the Cooling-aware GLB model, aggregate carbon emissions can be reduced by more than 50\% as compared to LOCAL if the total renewable energy supply is equal to the total IT demand. If more renewable energy is available, the carbon emission of Cooling-aware GLB is even less than half of that of Cooling-oblivious GLB.

The environmental impact of our new model is significant. \carbondioxide{} emissions are reduced even even when firms' optimizations do not consider the environmental externality of \carbondioxide{} emissions. Environmental benefits could be even greater if firms are given incentives to be environmentally friendly.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{GLB versus Storage}

\begin{figure}

\epsfig{file=cost_storage.pdf, height=2.2in, width=3.2in}
\caption{Comparison of optimal costs of the storage model and the Cooling-aware GLB model.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=brown_storage.pdf, height=2.2in, width=3.2in}
\caption{Comparison of brown energy usage of the storage model and the Cooling-aware GLB model.}
\end{figure}
One alternative way of using renewable energy efficiently is to store the extra renewables at some moments for future use. Whereas applying geographical load balancing adjusts energy demand according to supply in each location, adding energy storage adjusts supply according to demand. We are interested in the performance characteristics of both methods. In this experiment, we compare the cost curve and the brown energy usage curve of using GLB and using storage. Since our experiment starts at midnight, the time when the data centers are likely to have used all of its storage for batch jobs \cite{adam:cooling}, we assume that the storage starts empty.

Figure 5 illustrates the trend of optimal costs of these models with respect to varying renewable availability. It shows that Cooling-aware GLB has lower costs when the total renewable energy is less than 1.5 times the aggregate IT demand, and the storage model is better when renewable energy is in large surplus.

Figure 6 compares brown energy under each model. The result suggests that the Cooling-aware GLB model needs less energy from the grid compared to the 6-hour-storage curve when the total renewable supply is less than 1.5 times of the total IT power demand. Moreover, it needs less grid energy than the total renewable energy compared to the 3-hour-storage model, in almost the entire renewable availability interval, except when the renewable availability coefficient is 0.5. The environmental impact advantage of our new model is even more salient than to the cost advantage.

We thus can conclude that our model is better than the storage model when the renewable generation facilities are not yet built, because it requires less prior infrastructure investment.

Our simulation and visualization software can be used to answer questions about extensions to the model that would be useful when putting it into practice, such as—
\begin{itemize}
\item incorporating other kinds of renewables into the model
\item treating data centers as endogenous. In the long run, where should we build new data centers, and what local renewables and energy storage systems do we use?
\item finding the optimal control timescale. It is costly to switch servers on and off, so the current algorithms only change routing every fixed period, which is suboptimal. This significantly restricts the savings that follow-the-renewables routing can yield, but the topic hasn’t yet been explored deeply. Being able to simulate the whole system helps for this.
\item helping discover and then exploit emergent phenomena when looking at systems of many data centers. An example of such a phenomenon deals with the optimal mix of renewable energy for powering data centers. Since the sun shines in the daytime when people are awake and searching the internet, one might expect solar power to dominate. But Wierman’s paper showed that in fact wind is more effective, because its low spatial and temporal correlation is especially useful for geographical load balancing. With solar power, when requests come at night you are forced to buy electricity off the grid, but with wind power, it’s almost always windy somewhere.
